# Nuclei-Segmentation-using-U-NET

# Overview
This project aims to automate the detection of cell nuclei in microscopic images using the U-Net++ architecture. The task is part of the 2018 Data Science Bowl, where the goal is to accelerate research for various diseases by expediting nucleus detection.

# Motivation
Identifying cell nuclei is a crucial step in understanding biological processes and expediting drug development. By automating nucleus detection, this project aims to contribute to the acceleration of medical research and the development of cures for various diseases.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the 2018 Data Science Bowl, consisting of microscopic images for training (stage1_train) and testing (stage1_test). The images contain information about the location and characteristics of cell nuclei.
